# Pixel-Quest-Retro-Coin-Collector
This project is a simple 90s-style pixel art game built using Three.js. The objective of the game is to control the player using the WASD keys, navigate through the world, and collect all the coins scattered across the map. Once all coins are collected, the player wins the game.

Features
Third-person Camera: The camera follows the player from behind to give a third-person perspective.
Coin Collection: The player can collect coins by moving near them.
Retro Pixel Art Design: Simple block designs for a nostalgic 90s feel.
Basic WASD Controls: Movement controls are intuitive, using the W, A, S, D keys.
Win Condition: The game shows a winning message when all coins are collected.

How to Play
Open the game in any modern browser.
Use the W, A, S, D keys to move the player:
W: Move forward
A: Move left
S: Move backward
D: Move right
Collect all the coins (shown as yellow cubes).
When all coins are collected, the message "ðŸŽ‰ You Won the Game! ðŸŽ‰" will appear.
Game Design
Player: A green pixel-art-style block represented as a 1x2 box.
Ground: A flat green surface that acts as the play area.
Coins: Yellow pixel-art-style cubes that the player must collect.
Walls: Boundaries made of gray boxes to define the game area.
